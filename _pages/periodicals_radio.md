### Who Built It?

Remember this name: Tong Xiaoyong 童效勇 (Call Sign: BA1AA). Mr. Tong collected these periodicals over decades, not for himself, but for the HAM community. CRAC digitalized these materials and made them available to the public in April 2015. To learn more about the stories behind this collection, read these three articles that we have translated into English:
