I am Dorothy Dai, a recent graduate from UBC, majoring in Asian Area Studies. My interests include Sinophone literature and gender studies. In the project "Radio Culture in Modern China," my primary role was to curate a brief list of noteworthy segments in archival radio magazines and provide observations and textual analysis.
