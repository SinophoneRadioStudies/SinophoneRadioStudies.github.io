###Message from Xiangjun "Sean" Feng:

Hello!

This website aims to become a companion to the historical studies of radio in China and the global Sinophone communities. It is currently under construction, but please expect to see these contents soon:

- Annotated radio studies bibliography.

For now, I hope you will enjoy this Open Access article of mine:

["The Birth of Noise in Modern China: Radio, Amateur Engineering, and the Sonic Network."](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17508061.2023.2280435)

Please know that there wil be minor changes in the version appearing in the paper-copy of the journal, and this online version will be updated accordingly.

- Selected and annotated PDF files of historical radio periodicals published in China in the 1920s-1940s.

For now, I hope you are enjoying browsing the photos already posted here, which is a miniature sample of the named archive.

- Audio recordings of (fragments of) historical Chinese/Sinophone radio programs.

This won't be easy!! But let's see how many we can collect.

- Introduction to the project "Radio Culture in Modern China, 1923-1949."

This is an Insight Development Grant (IDG) project supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). File Number: 430-2023-00639. This website is funded by this grant.

A series of short essays by Dorothy Dai, the Student Academic Assistant to this project, will appear here soon. Other progresses will also be updated.

- Links to other radio studies resources.

Please keep an eye on this website's new developments.

Meanwhile, I'd love to thank these institutions and scholars who have supported this project in different forms (listed alphabetically):
