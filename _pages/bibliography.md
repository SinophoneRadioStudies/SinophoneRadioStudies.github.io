# Radio Studies Bibliography—General
For a comprehensive bibliography on radio studies, we recommend Shawn VanCour’s [“Radio and Sound Studies”](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/display/document/obo-9780199791286/obo-9780199791286-0312.xml?rskey=08nL8B&result=1&q=radio#firstMatch) available through Oxford Bibliographies. The same service also offers an entry titled [“Radio Studies”](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/display/document/obo-9780199756841/obo-9780199756841-0094.xml?rskey=08nL8B&result=2&q=radio#firstMatch) by Stephen Lax; however, it was last updated in 2012 and does not appear to have been revised since.
Please note that these sources are not open access, which may pose challenges for independent scholars or those whose institutions do not subscribe to this service. To address this, we will soon provide a short list of essential works. While it may not be as extensive as the aforementioned bibliographies, it will serve as a solid starting point.

Another limitation of these two bibliographies is their lack of content on China and the Sinophone worlds. To fill this gap, we have created the section below.

We are starting with a list of publications in reverse chronological order, and we plan to include annotations in the future. If you believe we have overlooked any significant works, please feel free to contact us at seanx.feng@utoronto.ca. Your contributions are greatly appreciated!
