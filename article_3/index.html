At the time, the only pre-liberation radio station in Suzhou, the Jiuda Silk and Cotton Store Broadcasting Station, had ceased operation, leaving only a tar-coated wooden antenna pole on the roof of the Beiju National Goods Company. The nearest stations, the East China People’s Broadcasting Station and the Shanghai People’s Broadcasting Station, were both more than 80 kilometers away from Suzhou. Reception during the day was decent, but after dusk, the signals became unstable, mingled with increasingly strong overseas broadcasts and the whistling and buzzing of interference. Programs from Shanghai in the upper range of the AM band were sometimes completely drowned out by powerful interference. To listen to the Pingtan storytelling program on 1330 kHz, my father couldn’t help but repeatedly take the radio to our neighbor Mr. Gong Enzu, a physics teacher, for “repairs.” Many years later, I realized the issue had been due to wave propagation, not a fault in the radio. However, Mr. Gong, likely out of courtesy to a neighbor, could not refuse and would symbolically adjust the intermediate-frequency transformer before returning it. Each time, I would go along to watch the “repairs.” Mr. Gong’s house was filled with an air of mystery, with radios awaiting repair spread across every surface and clocks needing fixing hanging on the walls. One day, Mr. Gong said, “Since you’re interested in radio, why don’t I lend you some books to read?” He had a stack of radio magazines about one and a half meters tall. He told me that when he fled westward during the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he lost everything except his radio books and a transformer, which he kept by his side at all times. He cherished those books dearly, allowing me to borrow only two at a time. Later, Mr. Gong moved from our Cuqu Alley to Ejing Alley. After his passing, I continued borrowing books from his frail widow. This borrowing arrangement lasted from my fifth year in elementary school through my graduation from middle school.</p> <p>小学年代，父亲借来一台日产五灯中波收音机。当时苏州解放前唯一的久大绸布庄广播电台已经停播，仅在北局国货公司楼顶剩下一根涂满柏油的天线木杆。最近的华东人民广播电台和上海人民广播电台都在离苏州80 公里以外，白天收听效果不错，但一过黄昏，信号就开始飘摇不定，夹杂着一阵强过一阵的海外广播和嗡嗡吱吱的啸叫声，中波段高端的上海节目有时被完全淹没在强大的干扰中。为了收听1330 千赫的评弹，我父亲忍不住一次又一次地把收音机送到住在后院的邻居物理老师龚恩祖先生那里去“修理”。很多年后我才懂得这本是电波传播的问题而非收音机出毛病，只是当时龚先生可能碍于邻居情面不好推拒，每次只得象征性地调一调中周变压器再送回来。每次我都跟着去看“修理”，龚先生家铺天盖地摆满了待修理的收音机，墙上挂满了待修理的钟表，一派神秘气氛。龚先生说：既然你对无线电感兴趣，不如借书给你看吧。他有大约一米半高的一堆无线电杂志，据说他抗日战争爆发后向西逃难，什么东西都丢光了，唯独无线电书刊和一个变压器寸步不离。他很珍惜这些书刊，每次只准我借两本，后来龚先生从我们住的醋库巷搬到了鹅颈弯，龚先生去世，我也没有中断从瘦弱的龚师母手中继续借阅，从小学五年级一直轮换借阅到初中毕业。</p> <p>These books and magazines introduced me to the world of radio technology. Among them, the most striking visual impression came from the exquisite covers of QSP and The China Radio; the greatest aspiration they inspired in me was to own an amateur radio station; and the most moving aspect was the authors’ expressions of lament over China’s backwardness and their passionate calls to strive for progress through radio technology.</p> <p>这些书刊把我带入了无线电技术的殿堂。这些杂志中给我印象最深的外观是《QSP》、《中国无线电》的精美封面，给我带来的最向往的目标是拥有一部业余电台，给我带来的最大感动的是文章作者对中国落后表达的唏嘘和希望通过无线电奋发图强的呼喊。</p> <p>In the blink of an eye, 38 years had passed. In 1991, I requested a transfer to the Radio Sports School under the State Sports Commission, believing that the key to unlocking China’s long-suppressed amateur radio activities might be found there. To my surprise and delight, I once again came across the Chinese amateur radio magazines, which had been collected by Mr. Tong Xiaoyong starting before the Cultural Revolution.</p> <p>眨眼间时间过去了 38 年。1991 年，我要求调到国家体委无线电运动学校工作，以为打开中国被长期禁锢的业余电台活动的金钥匙就藏在那里。在那里，惊喜地再次见到了久违的中国业余无线电老杂志，那是童效勇老师从文革前开始收集起来的。</p> <p>In 1994, the State Sports Commission underwent institutional reforms, and the Radio Sports School was abolished. Several units were merged into a single “Sports Management Center” within the same compound. The original five-story office building was rented out, and the offices were relocated to small rooms partitioned from a former dining hall and a conference room. The radio department, which had previously occupied eleven offices and a stairwell storage area, was reduced to just one office, a small radio room, and a small storeroom. The drastic reduction in office space left no room for a large amount of materials and equipment donated by foreign amateur radio enthusiasts. After several rounds of office relocations, only the scrap collectors seemed happy, while we could only feel heartbroken. Apart from urging the Beijing amateur radio organizations to select and take away a batch of relatively modern amateur radio books and magazines, only a small portion of the materials could be preserved, including this batch of old books and magazines collected by Mr. Tong Xiaoyong. Subsequently, as the unit’s responsibilities changed and new personnel arrived, office space became just sufficient for storing current supplies on a rotational basis. Older inventory had to be relegated to the corners of storage rooms, constantly at risk of being swept out as trash. Meanwhile, as time passed, the aging of these materials became increasingly severe, with some journals deteriorating to the point where pages crumbled into paper fragments upon being flipped. This deeply impressed upon us the extreme fragility of these precious historical materials. Relying on the efforts of any single unit or individual to preserve them properly for the long term and make them accessible to more people is an incredibly challenging task.</p> <p>1994 年国家体委机构改革，无线电运动学校撤销，几个单位合并到院子里成为一个“运动管理中心”，原五层办公主楼出租，办公室挤到由餐厅和会议室隔成的小屋，无线电部门从原来使用十一间办公室加一个楼梯间库区，压缩到一间办公室、一间小电台室、一间小库房。办公面积的缩水使大量资料以及国外业余无线电爱好者赠送的器材无处容纳，几次调整办公室，只有捡废品的老乡笑了，我们只声(sic)心痛。除了让北京火腿团队赶紧选走一批比较现代的业余无线电书刊外，能够重点保存下来的只是一小部分，其中就包括童效勇老师收集的这批老书刊。此后，由于单位工作的变化和新人员的到来，办公空间只够用来滚动放置当前用品，老旧存货不得不淘汰到仓库角落，随时面临当成垃圾扫地出门的命运。同时，随着时间的推移，资料介质的老化也日渐严重，有些期刊已经到了一翻阅就掉下很多纸渣的地步。这使我们深切地感到这些濒危珍贵历史资料是何等地脆弱，要靠任何单位或者个人的力量长久地妥善保存下去并为更多人所利用绝非易事。</p> <p>On the other hand, with the opening of amateur radio activities over the past two decades, retrospective articles on the history of amateur radio in China have begun to appear in domestic media. However, due to a lack of first-hand primary sources, some of these articles suffer from insufficient research, imprecise wording, and a failure to clearly distinguish between facts and conjectures. This raises a serious issue regarding whether the rich and complex history and culture of amateur radio in China can be accurately preserved and passed down.</p> <p>另一方面，随着业余无线电最近二十多年的开放，国内媒体也开始出现一些后人撰写的中国业余无线电历史回顾文章，由于缺乏一手原始资料，其中有一些文章考证不足，措辞不严，事实和推论评议难以区分。这是一个涉及我国业余无线电丰富曲折的历史和文化能否被准确地传承下去的严肃问题。</p> <p>Therefore, it is of great importance to ensure that first-hand materials, which most accurately reflect the original historical context, are accessible for reference and use by more people now and in the future, rather than being locked away in some corner. After much deliberation, the most feasible approach within our means is to convert this collection of historical primary sources into digital image files and make them openly available to any interested amateur radio enthusiasts and scholars. This approach of “treasuring the materials among the people” ensures that as long as even one copy survives for a century, future generations will be able to easily replicate and share it.</p> <p>因此，能否让最真实地反映历史原状的第一手资料在现在或将来为更多的人所拥有、参考、利用，而不仅是闭锁在某个角落里，具有十分重要的意义。想来想去，力所能及的最可行办法，是将这批历史原始资料处理成数字影像文件，开放式地提供给任何感兴趣的业余无线电爱好者和社会学者，来个“藏宝于民”，这样只要有其中一份能够流传百年，我们的后人就能够轻易地复制分享。</p> <p>In 2010, the establishment of the Amateur Radio Working Committee under the China Radio Association provided an opportunity to carry out this endeavor. The effort to preserve historical primary materials received assistance and support from the leadership of the [Radio Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology], as well as strong cooperation from the [China Radio Sports Association]. After confirming the technical capabilities of the professional digital processing unit and securing the necessary funding, a bold decision was made to disassemble the binding of the previously bound volumes to ensure the scanning quality of every page. As a result, most of the materials in this digital collection feature clear images, faithfully preserving the details of each page from the original publications.</p> <p>2010 年中国无线电协会业余无线电工作委员会成立，为落实这件事提供了契机。抢救历史原始资料工作得到了工业和信息化部无线电管理局领导的帮助和支持，也得到了中国无线电运动协会的大力配合。在确认了专业数码处理单位的技术能力、落实了经费之后，为保证每一页的扫描质量，破釜沉舟地拆开了原合订本的装订。因此，这套光盘中大部分资料的图像都很清晰，真实地保留了原始刊物每一页的细节。</p> <p>A small portion of this collection consists of photographs taken by Mr. Tong Xiaoyong and others using cameras in libraries. Due to limited conditions, some of the images suffer from uneven brightness caused by poor lighting, others are out of focus because the cameras lacked macro capabilities, and some are significantly distorted due to the inability to fully flatten thick bound volumes. During post-production, certain distortions were manually corrected. However, due to the limitations of the available software, images had to be manually divided into smaller sections for separate processing. While this portion of the collection is relatively small, the corrections required considerable time and only partially improved the readability (see the attached pages). The final results remain less than ideal, with no corrections made for out-of-focus images or uneven brightness. This remains a regrettable limitation.</p> <p>本套资料中还有一小部分是童效勇老师等从图书馆用照相机翻拍的。条件有限，有的光照条件不良，翻拍件亮度不匀；有的因相机没有近拍功能，聚焦不佳；有的因厚合订本无法摊平，图像变形比较严重。在后期制作中对部分变形进行了人工矫正，但手头的软件功能有限，只能把图像人工分割为小区分别处理，这部分资料所占比例不大，花费时间不少，但也只能在某种程度上提高阅读舒适度（参见附页），最终结果仍然不很理想。对于散焦和亮度不匀则没有处理。这是遗憾的地方。</p> <p>The processing principle for these materials was to preserve as much of the supplementary information carried by the original publications as possible. This includes not only faithfully retaining the text and images but also capturing the details of the layout and printing, the texture and characteristics of the paper, and even supplementary content such as advertisements, train schedules, and radio station frequency charts. Additionally, marks of ownership, readers’ annotations, and other unique features of the publications were preserved, allowing readers to extract richer information from the materials.</p> <p>资料的加工原则是尽量保留原刊物所携带的附加信息，不但包留文字和图片的原样，也尽量保留了排版印刷细节、纸张质感和特征，乃至插附的广告、火车时刻表、广播电台频率表，以及刊物的收藏印记、读者所加的批注等，以便读者从中提取更丰富的信息。</p> <p>This collection represents the labor and dedication of several generations of Chinese amateur radio enthusiasts. Some of these materials were even written and printed under the extremely difficult conditions of the War of Resistance. Each volume shines with the sincerity, diligence, wisdom, and selflessness of its original authors and publishers. The ability to access these materials today is primarily thanks to the tireless efforts of veteran Chinese amateur radio operators in collecting and preserving them, particularly Mr. Tong Xiaoyong (BA1AA), who has devoted over 50 years to this cause. This digital collection also reflects the selfless work of amateur radio enthusiasts in the later stages of organization and processing. Liu Tao (BG1DO) and Yin Hu (BD1AZ) coordinated to facilitate the handling of the materials, Lü Peiyan (BD1NG) meticulously compiled the index and handled post-processing, and Liang Tiewei (BA7NQ) carefully proofread the index links. In addition, Bill Fong (W6BBA), a HAM in California, USA, contributed Chinese amateur radio journals he had treasured for decades. Much of the acquisition and scanning of these materials also benefited from the resources of national or collective institutions.</p> <p>这套资料是我国几代业余无线电爱好者的劳动成果，有些甚至是在抗日战火极其困难的条件下赶写、赶印出来的，每一册都闪耀着原作者和出版者纯正、勤劳、智慧、奉献的光芒。大家之所以能看到它们，首先要感谢我国老业余无线电家在征集资料中的努力工作，特别是童效勇老师BA1AA 为此至今坚持不懈地努力了前后50 年。这套光盘也凝结着业余无线电爱好者在后期整理加工中付出的无私劳动：刘涛（BG1DO）和尹虎（BD1AZ）为保存和集中资料的协调努力，吕佩岩（BD1NG）编制索引和后期处理的细致工作，梁铁威（BA7NQ）对索引链接的精心校对… 美国加州的业余无线电爱好者Bill Fong（W6BBA）也曾贡献自己珍藏了几十年的中国业余无线电老期刊。此外，大部分资料的购买和扫描处 理也借助了国家或集体单位的资源。</p> <p>Today, the production of this digital collection has taken a clear shape. Taking the opportunity to commemorate the 75th anniversary of [China Amateur Radio Day] on May 5th, it is being made publicly available for use by HAMs and friends who are interested in amateur radio. We hope that everyone treats this collection as a treasure worthy of cherishing and respect—not merely as a collectible, but as a resource to uncover its rich knowledge value. Through this collection, we encourage readers to directly experience, learn from, and carry forward the noble amateur radio spirit of our predecessors. We also hope that everyone joins us in the challenging task of accurately preserving and promoting the true history of Chinese amateur radio, along with the dedication and patriotism of those who came before us.</p> <p>今天光盘制作有了一个基本眉目。趁纪念5 月5 日“中国业余无线电节”七十五周年的机会，公开出来提供给广大业余无线电爱好者和关心业余无线电的朋友们使用。希望大家把它当作值得珍惜和敬畏的宝贝，不仅仅是收藏，而且要充分发掘它的知识价值，通过它更加直接地感受、学习和发扬它所承载的先辈们的崇高业余无线电精神。也希望大家和我们一道，努力完成把中国业余无线电的真实历史和先辈们的敬业、爱国精神准确传承下去、发扬光大的艰巨任务。</p> <h5 id="appendix-examples-of-manually-processed-photographs">Appendix: Examples of Manually Processed Photographs</h5> <h5 id="附页照相版人工处理举例">附页：照相版人工处理举例</h5> <p>(Omitted)</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Xiangjun Feng.
